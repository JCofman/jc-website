TLDR;

- A stack in terms of computer science is a data structure to store a collection of elements
- There are two core functionalities for stacks
  - You can ‚ûï add an element on top üîù
  - And also ‚ûñ remove an element pop from the top (the most recently added element)

## What is a Stack

In real-life situations, stacks can be found everywhere. In your kitchen where your plates are stacked on top of each other, you can see a perfectly working stack. If you have a clean plate you put it on top of the stack and if you want to get a fresh one you typically just take them from the top of the stack. There are literally thousands of memes about stacks.

## Stacks in JavaScript

In JavaScript, stacks can be used to implement do and undo functionality.

The JavaScript language itself uses a call stack to figure out which function to call next. There is an awesome talk about how this works by Phillip Roberts and you can find a detailed explanation on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Call_stack)

You can implement a stack using an array. The following example shows an implementation using functions with a function
constructor.

```jsx
/**
 * Represents a stack.
 * @constructor
 * @param {array} items - the array to store elements in the stack
 */
const Stack = (items = []) => {
  let _storage = items;
  /**
   * Returns and removes the top element of the stack.
   * @return {*} the most recently added element of the stack
   */
  const pop = () => {
    return _storage.pop();
  };

  /**
   * Adds a new element at then end (on top) of the stack.
   * @param {*} element which should be put on top of the stack
   */
  const push = (element) => {
    _storage.push(element);
  };

  /**
   * Returns the current size (length) of the stack
   * @return {number} current size of the stack
   */
  const size = () => {
    return _storage.length;
  };

  /**
   * Returns the value at the end of the stack without removing it
   * @return {*} the last and newest value in the stack
   */
  const peek = () => {
    return _storage[size() - 1];
  };

  /*
   * @return {*} wheter no values are stored in stack
   */
  const isEmpty = () => {
    return _storage.length === 0;
  };

  /**
   * Empties the stack
   */
  const reset = () => {
    _storage = [];
  };

  return {
    pop,
    push,
    peek,
    size,
    reset,
    isEmpty,
  };
};
```

On [Visaulgo](https://visualgo.net/en/list) you can also find awesome visual representations of a stack.

They used a list to implement the Stack instead of an array.
