tl;dr

- try to embrace some awesome OS performance tools
- its much easier to run perf tools on public projects which are hosted on github ( which is often
  not the case for most a lot of sites.... maybe thats the reason why many popular sites are not as
  fast as they can be)
- use the open-source tools and contribute back :)

I am a passionate web developer who had (not only) once bought a domain, a server and started a
blog. But I did shut it down after usually some months or so. When I asked several of my colleagues
which work in the same industry as I do man of them told me that they had started a blog while back
ago and closed it several months later (like me).

In conclusion I think that happens to a lot of people üôà. But I want to try it again and start this
blog by also talking about topics which fascinate me it. The last time I have started to create a
website I have lost the interessed and passion about the my own site pretty fast. I didn't have
improve or develope it furthermore after I had finalized it. Now I want to start again and share
some knowledge and my opinions on diffrerent topics since I have recognized that when I write things
down I feel that I can keep the knowledge much better.

It's actually a pretty shinny era when you are a web developer, especially in the JavaScript scene.
There are a lot of things going on. Use a fast base and embrace all the Open Source performance
tools to not get slower

Before I can start creating the blog, I want to make sure to set up all the web dev performance
tools which I think are helpful to measure different aspects of web performance. I want to make sure
that the blog is accessible to everyone so it should be fast, bulletprof, seo optimized so people
can actually find it...

### Setting the baseline

If you want all the things mentioned above you have to make sure that these things get tested
regularly while developing your stuff. So what I want to do is to run different CI jobs which
analyse my site after I deploy a change. I decided to create my blog based on gatsby since it uses
react and some other fancy new tech which I have some more or less familarity with and as mentioned
by several blog posts is super fast. So what I did first was to measure the starting point when
creating a new project with gatsby-cli. I use lighthouse which is develpped by google to measure the
baseline for gatsby.

- first install gatsby-cli

```js
npm install --global gatsby-cli //or
yarn add gatsby-cli --global
```

- create a new gatsby side

```js
gatsby new gatsby-site
```

- build and serve the production a production build (so that all the js, css files get bundled
  minified and served by a local server)

```js
gatsby build
gatsby serve
```

this will boot up a server which hosts your statical stuff. Now we want to measure how fast
gatsby-js is at the begining of a project. Be aware this measurement uses a site provisioned by
gatsby-cli v.1.1.48.

So when

## First Automate the build process

- travis deployment
- zeit urls

For each feature we want to make sure to run some steps to check the performance therefore we need
to make sure that each pull request gets deployed to a different url to run tests on the url and
make sure that all deployments have same settings. We use zeit now.sh to make immutable deployments
which are deployed by travis CI

## First automate the performance testing

### defining your budget

performance budgets are an essential but under-appreciated part of product success and team health.
Most partners we work with are not aware of the real-world operating environment and make
inappropriate technology choices as a result. We set a budget in time of <= 5 seconds first-load
Time-to-Interactive and <= 2s for subsequent loads. We constrain ourselves to a real-world baseline
device + network configuration to measure progress. The default global baseline is a ~\$200 Android
device on a 400Kbps link with a 400ms round-trip-time (‚ÄúRTT‚Äù). This translates into a budget of
~130-170KB GZIP of critical-path resources, depending on composition ‚Äî the more JS you include, the
smaller the bundle must be.

### Lightweight tools

- [size-limits](https://github.com/ai/size-limit)

perfect for checking the whole bundle size

- [budlesize](https://github.com/siddharthkp/bundlesize)

perfect for checking each vendor (commons) bundle and async chunks

There are some easy integrated open-source-tools to check the size of your bundle for each
deployment. This makes sure you dont deploy an oversized budget.

gatsbyjs [lighthouse](https://github.com/ebidel/lighthouse-ci) 1.add lighthouse First we want to
automate the deployment process now makes it pretty easy to test all our changes on perf aspects
before mergin pull requests. it generates a custom url for al deployments.
